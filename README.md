AI Agent with LangGraph and Mem0

## Overview

In this guide, we will build a **Personalized Customer Support AI Agent** using the following tools:

- **LangGraph**: To manage conversation flow.
- **Mem0**: To store and retrieve relevant information from past interactions.

This integration enables context-aware and efficient support experiences, providing personalized responses based on user history.

## Setup and Configuration

### Install necessary libraries

To get started, you will need to install the required libraries. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install langgraph langchain-openai mem0ai



## Description

This project allows you to build an Agent using LangGraph to manage the conversation flow and Mem0 to store and retrieve information from past interactions. Mem0 integration allows for context-aware responses tailored to the user's history.

## Key Features

### 1. Memory Integration
The system uses Mem0 to store and retrieve relevant information from past interactions. This ensures that the support agent can consider previous conversations, providing more accurate responses tailored to the user's needs.

### 2. Personalization
The agent provides responses based on the user's context and history. Thanks to Mem0 integration, the agent can tailor its responses based on the stored information, offering a personalized experience.

### 3. Flexible Architecture
The LangGraph structure allows for easy expansion of the conversation flow. You can add new nodes, define transitions between states, and seamlessly adapt the support agent's behavior.

### 4. **Continuous Learning**
Each interaction is stored and used to **improve future responses**. Over time, the agent becomes more efficient and accurate, learning from past interactions to provide better solutions and a smoother experience.
